BREAKING: A massive earthquake, and tsunami, hit Japan earlier this afternoon, just before 5pm Melbourne time. The tsunami is currently on its way across the Pacific and people in several other countries are potentially in danger. Australia is apparently not directly threatened, but many Pacific islands appear to be at risk. If that describes your present location, please get to higher ground.



ABC News 24 is covering it fairly comprehensively at the moment.

UPDATE: Some idiots appear to be desperate to use this tragedy to bash their ideological opponents, even if the best quotes they can find are merely random twitterers.

The same people seem to be neglecting similarly  sentiments expressed close to home, however. (Or here.)

But seriously, is this really necessary? I’m sure people on all sides of politics are appalled by the devastation here. Let’s leave it at that for now, shall we?
