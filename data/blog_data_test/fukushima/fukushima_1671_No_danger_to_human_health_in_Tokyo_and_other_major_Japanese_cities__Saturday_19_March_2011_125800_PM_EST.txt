Radiation dose rates in Tokyo and other cities remain far from levels which would require action the International Atomic Energy Agency reported overnight. The Agency is receiving regular dose rate information from 47 Japanese cities. Rates at all of them are not dangerous to human health.

First measurements in Tokyo by the Agency’s newly arrived radiation monitoring team on Friday showed no indication of Iodine-131 or Caesium-137. A second sampling was to be carried out overnight.

At his 14:00 UTC briefing on 18 March, Graham Andrew, Special Adviser to the IAEA Director General on Scientific and Technical Affairs, repeated his assessment of the previous day that the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants remains very serious, but there has been no significant worsening since our last briefing.

The situation at the reactors at Units 1, 2 and 3 appears to remain fairly stable.

Seawater was injected yesterday into Unit 2 and white smoke was again observed through the blown-out panels.

At Unit 3, which was the subject of helicopter water drops yesterday, water cannons have been spraying water on the spent fuel pond and seawater was injected into the reactor pressure vessel.

An important safety concern remains the spent fuel pools at Units 3 and 4. Information is lacking on water levels and temperatures at the spent fuel pools.

Efforts are being made to restore electrical power to the whole site. Another positive development is that diesel generators are providing power for cooling for both Units 5 and 6.

No problems have been reported at the common spent fuel pool. The spent fuel in the pool is fully covered by water.
