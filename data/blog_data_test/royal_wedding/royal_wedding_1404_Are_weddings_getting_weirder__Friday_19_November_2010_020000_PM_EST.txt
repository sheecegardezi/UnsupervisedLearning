People are doing it under the Golden Arches, underwater, in the nude and in Nazi uniforms. 



They get hitched in all manner of ways and the water-cooler conversations this week have been dominated by nuptials of all sorts. 

There’s the couple renewing their vows at McDonalds. Would you like a Happily Ever After meal with that?



Glenn McGrath married Sara Leonardi behind a veil of secrecy, not long after the McGrath Foundation clumsily asked its members if they thought the whirlwind relationship was “disrespectful” .

Then, of course, there’s the ongoing brouhaha over gay marriage, and the brewing excitement about the upcoming Royal wedding. 

It’s all enough to make you want to elope.

I once went to a wedding where there were two ceremonies – a (lengthy) Roman Catholic service followed by an Anglican one several kilometres away. 

The reception hall was split in half – her Italian relatives down one side and his Anglo mob down the other.  And there were two MCs. Yep – one speaking in Italian, the other in English. 

Weddings can be fantastic fun or catastrophic madness. 

They are a hotbed of emotion. 

Some people embrace the traditions and the marketing of weddings with gusto – behemoth dresses, towering cakes, acres of petals. 

Others strive for something more individual, something … unique. 

What’s the weirdest or the worst (or the best) wedding you’ve ever been to?
