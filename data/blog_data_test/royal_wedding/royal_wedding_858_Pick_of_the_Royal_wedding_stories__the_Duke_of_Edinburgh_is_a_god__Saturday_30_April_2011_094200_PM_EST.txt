The London Daily Telegraph reports how they are just waiting for word that the wedding has been held so celebrations can begin:

The Yaohannen inhabit a remote corner of Tanna, a small island that makes up part of the nation of Vanuatu, some 10,000 miles from Britain.

But they are linked to the Windsors through their unique belief system, which over the decades has come to hold the Duke of Edinburgh as a deity.

The tribe both worships the Duke and considers him to be a part of their extended family and they have been anxiously awaiting the auspicious occasion of his grandson’s wedding.

“They will put on a custom dance and display photographs that they have of Prince Philip and special objects, it is a very happy time for them,” explained Mr Kapere.

“They would love to receive a photograph of the married couple to add to their collection.”
