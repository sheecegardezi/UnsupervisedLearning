It really has been a massive week. AFL Broadcast Rights were announced, there was a Royal Wedding, Logies, and then there was that Osama business.

This week Dan and Dennis take a look at:

•The AFL Broadcast Rights announcement

•The Chasers Royal Wedding commentary has the kybosh put on it by Clarence House

•Dieter Brummer getting tired and emotional post-Logies.

•What needs to be done to spruce up the Logie Awards and make them, heaven forbid, watchable.

The Logie improvement discussion stems from this article that Dan wrote on the topic for Crikey. Also, for fans of regular panelist Simon, he will be back in a couple of weeks. Uni commitments are keeping him from podcasting for a while.

As always, we look forward to receiving your mail and check us out on the Twitter / Facebook. You can also find the podcast on iTunes (please leave us a review, it helps people find the show).

The show can be downloaded / listened to HERE.
